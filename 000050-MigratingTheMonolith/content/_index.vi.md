- Use AWS Tools for Eclipse to deploy a Java Application to an Elastic Beanstalk environment.
- Install and configure the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI tool.
- Use the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI to deploy an update to an existing Elastic Beanstalk environment.
- Use the AWS SDK to query and modify the AWS environment using code.
- Use the AWS SDK to create an S3 bucket, upload a file and delete the file and bucket.
