If you have time available, take your pick of the following to help solidify what you have learned in this module. If you donâ€™t have time to fully implement, at least consider what your approach would be, and discuss with your instructor:
> - Modify the Lambda function you used in the Kinesis-to-SQS exercise to modify the data in some other way, for example, changing the X-rotation rather than the Y-rotation.
> - Modify the Lambda function you used in the Kinesis-to-SQS exercise to send the messages read from the Kinesis stream to the SNS topic used for fan-out, so that you can see multiple consumers of the messages read from the stream.
> - Add another Lambda function to the Kinesis stream to perform processing on the stream in parallel.
> - Experiment with the dashboards feature of Kibana to create graphs that highlight information about the sales data being sent between the two EC2 instances.
