Congratulations! You now have successfully deployed the TravelBuddy website as a Single-Page web Application hosted on Amazon S3, with serverless Lambda microservices served via Amazon API Gateway which also provides throttling, quota management and DDoS protection. You have implemented secure logins via Amazon Cognito, and protected the API calls to require an appropriate bearer token for every call. You have subsequently enabled tracing using Amazon X-ray to provide full visibility to the applicationâ€™s processing.

TravelBuddy is ready to ship!
