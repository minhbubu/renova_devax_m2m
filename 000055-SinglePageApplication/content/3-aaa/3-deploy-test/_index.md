**Deploy and Test the new Behaviour**

1. You must re-deploy the API in order for the changes to take effect on your API. From the **Actions** drop-down button, click **Deploy API**. Deploy the API to the **prod** stage.
2. Switch over to your **TravelBuddy SPA web page**, and **refresh** it.
3. **Without** entering a destination value, click the **Go!** button. After a moment, you should see a *toaster* element appear stating that you must be logged-in in order to use the feature.
